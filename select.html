          <p>According to the World Rock Paper Scissors Association, The earliest Japanese “Rock-Paper-Scissors” game was known as “mushi-ken”, which was imported directly from China. In “Mushi-ken” the “frog” (represented by the thumb) is beaten by the “slug” (represented by the little finger), which in turn is beaten by the “snake” (represented by the index finger), which is beaten by the “frog”. Although this game was imported from China, the Japanese version differs in the animals represented.</p>
