This is a website devoted to playing three variations of rock-paper-scissors against a computer opponent. This project was inspired by a much simpler rock-paper-scissors game I made during my coding bootcamp. I hope you have fun playing this game!

I made this game using only methods and technologies I had learned during the initial javascript module in order to reinforce my understanding of vanilla javascript. These restrictions also meant I could not import or export functions, so there is a ton of repeated code. Please see my other work for better, cleaner code.

# How To Use
This is the welcome screen for the application, you can either choose to view this readme,  or select a game style, which will take you to our stage select screen.
![WelcomeScreen](./assets/welcomescreen.png)
On the stage select screen, you can scroll down to view all available play types. Click the image of the game you would like to play to launch that game. You may also return to the main menu by clicking on the button on the bottom of the page.
![StageSelect](./assets/stageselect.png)
Once in the game screen, you can switch between styles by using the menu at the top of the page. You may also use that menu to return to the main menu. To play the game click on the image that coresponds with your choice. The rules of each game are explained on the game page. A scoreboard on the right side of the page will keep track of how many games you win. When you select an option, a pop-up window will inform you of the outcome.
